# Savva Pistolas

I work across practical cybersecurity delivery (assessment, assurance, and offensive testing) and applied, human-centred tooling that makes systems safer and fairer.

I also co-founded **Turtledove**, a small UK-based development agency focused on technical enablement for good ideas.

## What I’m working on

### Security, assurance, and capability-building (ADAS)
- **Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus** delivery (including hands-on preparation support and assessment).
- **Penetration testing** and security validation.
- **ISO/IEC 27001** implementation support and policy development.

## MSc Applied Artificial Intelligence
I'm carrying out a MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Warwick University, aiming to puruse a PhD in radical alternatives for computing as a tool for social good; My MSc focuses on building with edge and tiny-llm to make knowledge accessible in hostile regions; a synthesis of efforts in building RAGs, effective signal from sparse datasets, and benchmarking/optimising on limited datasets. More to come on this soon.
